Please also have a look at the comprehensive notebook by HPL related to Chaper 6 of his book (3rd ed.). 

The original notebook was named plot.ipynb. We renamed it. It covers several topics, i.e. dictionaries, file IO and string operations.

We put the notebook and all its related files into the directory "nb0060_HPL_dicts_files_strings".
